# Publication ETL

This is a simple ETL system that will listen for XML documents to be uploaded to an S3 bucket by a publisher. When the document is uploaded, the date will be extracted from the document and transformed based on the publisher specific XSLT file. This transformation is to normalize the data from different publishers and load it into a database for downstream use.
