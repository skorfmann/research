        <name>Electrical Signals</name>
        <description>Electrical signals in the brain are generated by the movement of electrons through ion channels in the neuronal membrane, creating action potentials that propagate along neurons.</description>

        <name>Neurotransmission</name>
        <description>Neurotransmission is the process by which neurons communicate with each other, using chemical messengers called neurotransmitters that are released into the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on adjacent neurons, modulated by the electrical activity of the brain.</description>

        <name>Neural Circuits</name>
        <description>Neural circuits are interconnected networks of neurons that process and transmit information in the brain, with the flow of electrons playing a crucial role in the formation and modulation of these circuits.</description>
